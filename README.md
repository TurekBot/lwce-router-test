This is an Minimal, Reproducible Example of how to use [@lwce/router] in a [create-lwc-app] project.

I carefully followed [this video] in my attempt.

## How to start?

Start by running `npm install`.

Then run `npm run watch`.
This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/modules`](./src/modules) folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components.

Find more information on the main repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/muenzpraeger/create-lwc-app).
